Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a Python virtual environment then run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install abacus-tpot

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

This project has a ``.editorconfig`` file to help contributors define
and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and
IDEs.

We are using CircleCI for continuous integration.

Found a bug or want to propose something to the team? Create a new issue
if it is not listed `here`_. Even better, feel free to fork this repo,
make the changes and raise a PR. Weâ€™ll be more than happy to review it.

Testing
~~~~~~~

Run:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py test

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

Automatic Uploading to ``testpypi`` and ``pypi`` has been set in the CI
and only develop and master branches are deployed to the package
repositories respectively.

Ready to deploy? Update the version in ``setup.py`` and create a new git
tag with ``git tag $VERSION``. Once you push the tag to GitHub with
``git push --tags`` a new CircleCI build is triggered. Once the versions
are confirmed, booyah, you have a new version uploaded.
